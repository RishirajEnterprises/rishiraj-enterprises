# Rishiraj Enterprises â€” Static Website

This is a simple static site built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

Quick notes:
- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
- Main stylesheet: `css/style.css`.
- Main script: `js/script.js` (loaded with `defer`).

Recommendations:
- Add labels for form inputs for accessibility.
- Replace EmailJS placeholders with real keys only when ready, or send form data via a server endpoint to keep keys secret.
- Consider consolidating CSS selectors (there are some duplicated/overlapping styles) and removing unused rules.

If you want, I can:
- Add proper ARIA labels and <label> elements to the contact form.
- Run more automated checks (HTML validator, CSS linter) and apply fixes.
- Wire the contact form to EmailJS or a server endpoint securely.
